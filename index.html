                <h4>Our Story</h4>
                <p>
                    People Connect was born out of a simple yet profound idea: that people are at the heart of
                    everything we do.
                    We recognized the need for a platform that goes beyond the superficial connections often found on
                    social media,
                    and instead, focuses on creating authentic, enduring bonds. Our journey began
                    with a vision to provide a space where people can connect on a deeper level, share experiences,
                    and grow together.
